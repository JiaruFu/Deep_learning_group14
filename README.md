Before run the code, you should download the 'GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin' from https://drive.google.com/uc?id=0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM&export=download to the same path  with that of code. Maybe you should add the following code and run it before run the Jupyter Notebook code: 

import nltk 
nltk.download('punkt') 
nltk.download('stopwords')
